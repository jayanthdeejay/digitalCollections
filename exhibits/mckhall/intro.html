Thomas Loraine McKenney (1785-1859) served as Commissioner of Indian Affairs 1824-1830.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
that capacity he commissioned and collected portraits of Native Americans for his Gallery in the War Department.&nbsp;&nbsp;McKenney's 
goal was to publish a record of vanishing peoples: portraits, biographical sketches, and a history of North American Indians.&nbsp;&nbsp;He 
accomplished this in the first issue of <i>History of the Indian Tribes of North America</i>, published in three volumes between 1836 and 1844.&nbsp;&nbsp;This 
exhibit presents a selection of twenty-four images from <i>The History of the Indian Tribes of North America</i>, each representing a different Native American Nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each 
image is accompanied by a brief description.&nbsp;&nbsp;The images have been selected from copies of the <i>History</i> in the Archives &amp; Rare Books Department, University Libraries, University of Cincinnati.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
images also appear in:  <i>McKenney &amp; Hall's History of the Indian Tribes of North America:  The First Issue</i>.  Cincinnati, Ohio:  University of Cincinnati Digital Press, 2002.

Thomas Loraine McKenney (1785-1859) served as Commissioner of Indian Affairs 1824-1830.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
that capacity he commissioned and collected portraits of Native Americans for his Gallery in the War Department.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most 
of the portraits were painted by Charles Bird King (1785-1862) in Washington, D.C., during visits of Native delegations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other 
artists are represented, including James Otto Lewis (1799-1858).&nbsp;&nbsp;McKenney's 
goal was to publish a record of vanishing peoples: portraits, biographical sketches, and a history of North American Indians.&nbsp;&nbsp;He 
accomplished this in the first issue of <i>History of the Indian Tribes of North America</i>, published in three volumes between 1836 and 1844.&nbsp;&nbsp;James 
Hall (1793-1868) provided the text and Henry Inman (1801-1846) copied many of the original portraits for the publication.

<p>
King, who never traveled in the West, is best remembered as a painter of Native American portraits.&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
twenty years, beginning in 1822, he received commissions to paint Native American visitors to the Nation's Capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
commissions were instigated by Thomas L. McKenney, who served as Superintendent of Indian Trade 1816-1824 and Head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs 1824-1830.&nbsp;&nbsp;McKenney's 
great dream was the publication of the portraits with an accompanying history.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most 
of King's 143 Native American portraits were lost in the Smithsonian fire of 1865, but the images are preserved in McKenney &amp; Hall's monumental work.
</p>
<p>
The work of Henry Inman (1801-1846) is a significant element of this publication.&nbsp;&nbsp;His 
faithful copies of the portraits collected by McKenney were the models for the lithographs which appear in the <i>History</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many 
of Inman's copies were given to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology &amp; Ethnology at Harvard University in 1882 from the heirs of E.P. Tileston and Amor Hollingsworth, the last publisher of the <i>History</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many 
of the Inman paintings have subsequently passed into other institutions and private collections.
</p>
<p>
<i>The History of the Indian Tribes of North America</i> is a record of vanishing peoples:  portraits, biographical sketches, and a history of North American Indians.&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
is one of the finest  and most beautiful examples of hand-colored American lithography.&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
is one of the earliest collections of Native American portraits.&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
was the most extensive collection of such portraits until publication of <i>The North American Indian</i> by Edward S. Curtis beginning in 1880.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because 
most of the original portraits were destroyed in a fire in the Smithsonian Institution in 1865 these images form the only record not only of the individuals portrayed, but also of important works of 19<sup>th</sup> Century American artists.

images have been selected from copies of the <i>History</i> in the Archives &amp; Rare Books Department, University Libraries, University of Cincinnati.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
images also appear in:  <i>McKenney &amp; Hall's History of the Indian Tribes of North America:  The First Issue</i>.  Cincinnati, Ohio:  University of Cincinnati Digital Press, 2002.

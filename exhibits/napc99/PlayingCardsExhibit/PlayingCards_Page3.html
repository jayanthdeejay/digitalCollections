The first playing cards in America were imported from England and Europe.
&nbsp; Card making began here only after the Revolutionary War.
&nbsp; The first U.S. manufacturers, not surprisingly, were in the industrialized East.

After the Civil War, many new innovations were introduced into the making of cards, and new companies arose.
&nbsp; Among these were several firms belonging to the Longley Brothers, who worked in and around Cincinnati.
&nbsp; One of their rarest decks commemorated the 100th anniversary of the Revolution.

The Longleys faced competition from Russell and Morgan, Cincinnati printers of posters and lables.
&nbsp; In 1881, the partners expanded their operation to include playing cards.
&nbsp; This operation became so profitable that Russell and Morgan were able to absorb some of their competitors.

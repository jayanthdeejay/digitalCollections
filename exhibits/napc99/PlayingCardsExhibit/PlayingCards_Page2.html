In the Mamluke culture of Egypt, the suit-signs became Coins, Cups, Swords and Polo sticks.
&nbsp; Each suit had ten numerical cards and three figure cards (Commander, Lieutenant Commander and Second Lieutenant).
&nbsp; This was the type of card deck received in Europe c. 1350.
</P>
<P>
Europeans were ignorant of Polo and thus altered the sticks to Batons or Clubs.
&nbsp; The court cards were still male: King, Knight, Knave.
&nbsp; The first European cards were painted, but block printing was soon used for mass production.

<P>
Italians, around 1425, invented the game of Tarot, for which they added a Queen to each suit.
&nbsp; In France, about 50 years later, the Knight was dropped from the standard deck; the suit signs were Diamonds, Hearts, Spades and Clubs.
&nbsp; Now, only, the court cards needed to be printed from blocks; the suit-signs were stenciled.
&nbsp; This gave French card makers an advantage over those of other nations, and the French designs became international.
&nbsp; They were exported to England.
&nbsp; When Britain established colonies, her usual playing cards naturally settled there.

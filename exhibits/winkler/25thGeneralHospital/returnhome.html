		<p>By August 6, 1945, the 25th moved to the Army Hospital in Rouen, France, which it operated until September 21. On November 20, 1945, the 25th General Hospital was deactivated. Veterans of the 25th were entitled to wear three battle stars on their European Theater service ribbon for the campaigns of Northern France, Rhineland, and Ardennes (Battle of the Bulge). The 25th performed bravely and made much of its mark on military medicine through creative efficiencies that shortened the time from injury to treatment, practices that were emulated by other units.</p>

		<p id="bottom_p2">&ldquo;You are one of a group of general hospitals whose personnel has been called on to function under circumstances probably never faced prior to this war by general hospitals. These circumstances have been brought about by enemy action and by the necessity of moving general hospital units up to the fighting front. You have been called on to adapt a general hospital in such buildings as were available and at the same time maintain the superior medical service which has been standard in this Theater. Due to the necessity for beds you have been forced to move, set up your hospital, and operate rapidly. Your unit has met every challenge and has carried its full share of the work which has helped to create the superior record made by the Medical Department in this Theater.&rdquo;</p>

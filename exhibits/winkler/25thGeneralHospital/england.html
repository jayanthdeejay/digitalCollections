        <p>The 25th arrived in Stockbridge, England, on December 31, 1943. England was in the midst of the build-up of Allied Forces for Operation Overlord, the invasion of France. Military medical departments cared for the troops stationed and waiting in England, and prepared for the anticipated large numbers of casualties. The men and women of the 25th conducted experiments constructing tented and semi-permanent hospitals.</p>
        <p>The British, who had prepared for the worst possible German air blitz, had five extra hospitals that they furnished to the United States. The 25th occupied one of these hospitals in Stockbridge and then by March 1944 in Cirencester. The men and women of the 25th treated primarily the American sick and wounded until May 1944 when a series of temporary moves in the Advanced Section of the Communications Zone led to their attachment to the 1st Army and deployment to France on July 29.</p>

        <h4>First Action--Lison, France</h4>
        <p>On July 30, 1944, the 25th arrived on Utah Beach, about two months after D-Day. In Lison the unit established a 1,000 bed hospital&mdash;in tents set on concrete bases&mdash;which officially opened and received patients on August 15, 1944. Over the next three months the unit treated 3,104 patients, mostly battle casualties, including many wounded German prisoners. </p>

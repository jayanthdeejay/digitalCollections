    <h3>BARBARA (LINCOLN) ASHBAUGH&rsquo;S
PHOTOGRAPHS AND MEMOIRS</h3>
	<p>Barbara (Lincoln) Ashbaugh served as an American Red Cross psychiatric social worker in the 25th General Hospital. She kept a diary of her experiences and took many photographs. In 1994 Ms. Ashbaugh offered to the Winkler Center her photographs and a memoir. Many of the images in this exhibit are hers.</p>
	<p>Her memoir presents a very personal account of the 25th, starting with her opening sentence: &ldquo;Seeds of discontent were sown in my life; so I decided to go into the service with the American Red Cross in World War II as a psychiatric social worker.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>The 25th treated all wounded personnel, Allied and German. Ms. Ashbaugh&rsquo;s reaction to the wounded Germans was likely typical of her colleagues: &ldquo;I was struck by the ages of the German prisoners on our wards, for most were young boys in their teens and they looked like our men.&rdquo; (page 27)</p>

    <p>Fear was ever present. During the Battle of the Bulge, she writes: &ldquo;So ended 1944 in an atmosphere of excitement, dread, fear, uncertainty, real concern because of the Battle of the Bulge&hellip;that we might be defeated&hellip;I noted tanks going by in the wrong direction. Maybe they are lost, I thought. But when I hurried back to the hospital, I learned that we were indeed retreating.&rdquo; (pages 44 and 45)</p>

    <p>But humor and acts of kindness sustained Ms. Ashbaugh and her friends. In a field beside the tent hospital in Lison, France, resided a herd of cattle. She relates a close encounter: &ldquo;One cow disturbed my sleep in the middle of the night when she stumbled over the tent ropes outside, but next to my bed. I awoke with a start&hellip;and heard a MIGHTY MOO as she stumbled off into the dark.&rdquo; (page 30)</p>

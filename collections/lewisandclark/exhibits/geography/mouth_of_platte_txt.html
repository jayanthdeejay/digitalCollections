  &quot;The wind lulled at seven o'clock, and we reached, in the rain, the mouth
  of the great river Platte&#8230;Captains Lewis and Clarke ascended the river
  in a periogue, for about one mile, and found the current very rapid; rolling
  over sands, and divided into a number of channels; none of which are deeper
  than five or six feet.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1804, the Mouth of the Platte
  River was a frontier, the line of demarcation between the Lower and Upper Missouri
  River as well as the beginning of Indian Territory. At Council Bluffs, on the
  west bank a few miles north of the Mouth of the Platte, Lewis and Clark held
  their first council with the Indians, representatives of the Otto and Missouri
  tribes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">River junctions are strategic locations
  and often the location of .trading establishments Clark declared the site an
  excellent one for fortification. Fort Atkinson was built on Council Bluffs in
  1819 and a trading post was built at Bellevue, just above the Mouth of the Platte
  in 1809. In the 1830's the post at Bellevue was operated by the American Fur
  Company and also housed the Indian Agency to the Oto, Omaha, Pawnee and Iowa
  nations. Fort Atkinson, abandoned in 1827, has been reconstructed. Bellevue
  agency remains as a few tumbled foundation stones in Fontenelle Forest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">George Catlin (1796-1872) painted
  a view of the Mouth of the Platte in 1832 on his journey up the Missouri River
  on the maiden voyage of the American Fur Company steamboat Yellowstone from
  St. Louis to Fort Union at the Mouth of the Yellowstone River. During his six
  months on the river, Catlin painted hundreds of images in an effort to record
  people and lands which would soon vanish before the advance of civilization.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following year Maximilian, Prinz
  von Wied (1782-1867) traveled up the Missouri River, also on the Yellowstone,
  going as far as Fort McKenzie at the Mouth of the Marias River. He was engaged
  in a similar, if more organized project to document the Native Americans of
  the Northern Plains. Accompanying him was Karl Bodmer (1809-1893), the Swiss
  artist hired to provide the visual record. Maximilian's Travels in the Ineterior
  of North America in 1832-1834 appeared in German, French, and English editions
  between 1839 and 1843 and were accompanied by an atlas of 81 aquatints derived
  from Bodmer's watercolors. <br>

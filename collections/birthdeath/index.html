                    <p>This is a collection of over 528,000 records. The original official records are owned by the City of Cincinnati and housed in the Archives and Rare Books Library, University of Cincinnati Libraries, University of Cincinnati. The records,
                        consisting of index cards, were created by the Cincinnati Health Department several decades ago and are considered the official and legal records of births and deaths for this time period.</p>
                    <p>While the bulk of these records begin in 1865, a small number of records show earlier dates. It is believed that these early records reflect the "restoration" of vital documents by citizens after the 1884 Hamilton County Courthouse
                        fire, and were eventually sent to the City of Cincinnati Health Department for recording.</p>
                    <p>From this page you may browse and search across all records in this Community, or, to limit your results to a span of years, select a Collection below. Browse Subjects and enter 'cause' to jump to Cause of Death; browse subjects and
                        enter 'occupation' to browse occupations of a parent or a deceased individual. Names of those born or deceased, parent names, cause of death and occupations are all found in the subject index.</p>

                    <div class="collapse" id="faq1">
                        <p>With a few exceptions, the official death records for the City of Cincinnati begin in 1865 and those for birth in 1874. As a result of a government records program of the Ohio Network of American History Research Centers, in 2003
                            over 500,000 card files from the Cincinnati Health Department were transferred to the UC Libraries' Archives and Rare Books Library. The cards contain the official records of births and deaths for Cincinnati citizens from the
                            beginning dates as noted through 1908, with additional records through 1912. These cards are sometimes typed and many times handwritten, and were created by the Cincinnati Health Department several decades ago to preserve the
                            data originally entered in ledger books. The ledger books are also preserved in the UC Libraries, but are of such fragility that any turning of the pages results in flaking and tears. The informational cards are considered
                            the official and legal records of births and deaths for this time period.</p>
                        <p>While the bulk of these records begin in 1865, a small number of records show earlier dates. It is believed that these early records reflect the "restoration" of vital documents by citizens after the 1884 Hamilton County Courthouse
                            fire, and were eventually sent to the City of Cincinnati Health Department for recording.</p>
                        <p>For birth and death records created after 1912, consult the <a href="http://www.odh.ohio.gov/vitalstatistics/vitalstats.aspx">State of Ohio Vital Records Office</a> or the <a href="http://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/health/pages/-5138-/">Cincinnati Health Department</a>.
                            For birth or death records created between 1909 and 1912, even if found in this collection, you may be able to request a more complete record from these offices. Certificate numbers (typically found in the top right corner)
                            may be present in records in this collection from 1909-1912, and can be used to request the additional record. (Records in this collection before 1909 typically do not have certificate numbers.)</p>

                        <p>Birth records typically contain the name of the individual, birth date, race (often abbreviated as a single letter), gender (often abbreviated as 'M' or 'F'), name of father, name of mother, occupation of father, address (sometimes
                            a home address, sometimes a hospital address), and often but not always: the birthplace or nationality of the father and mother, the doctor or midwife, and the hospital. For death records: name, age, date of death, cause of
                            death, address, occupation, race, gender, attending physician, funeral home, and place of burial. Death records typically have an orange background, and birth records a white (often aged to off-white or yellow) background.</p>
                        <p>The names of individuals born or deceased, and the names of parents, are entered as Subjects. The date of birth or death is entered as the Issue Date. Occupation and Cause of Death are entered as Subjects, preceded respectively
                            by the phrase 'Occupation' or 'Cause of Death'. Address is entered in a Description field, preceded by the term 'Address:'. Age at death is entered in a Description field, preceded by the phrase 'Age at death:'. All other information
                            that appears on the record has been entered into a Description field, with individual elements separated by a forward slash ('‚ÅÑ').</p>

                        <p>Yes, by selecting browse options under "This Community", or by doing a full text search or an Advanced Search while you are on the Community page. (See red arrows on illustration below.) The main page of the Cincinnati Births and
                            Deaths collection is called a "Community" whereas the collections for individual date ranges are called "Collections".</p>

                        <p>You can do a full text search across all collections from the main community page, or within individual collections for year ranges. Enter the name in last name, first name format.</p>

                            on the original record are not changed. First choose <strong>subject browse</strong> from the main community page or within individual collections for a year range, and then enter "cause" where it says "<strong>Or enter first few letters</strong>"

                        <p>Occupations may be present on records either as the occupation of a deceased individual, or the occupation of a parent on a birth record. Occupations are entered in the <strong>Subject</strong> field. The term "Occupation" appears
                            before whatever occupation is noted on the record. Any abbreviations or misspellings on the original record are not changed. First choose <strong>subject browse</strong> from the main community page or within individual collections
                            for a year range, and then enter "occupation" where it says "<strong>Or enter first few letters</strong>" (see illustration below).</p>

                        <p>You can also use <strong>Advanced Search</strong> to combine occupation with cause of death, although variations in terminology and spellings complicate this task. From the main community page or from any individual collection
                            by year range, select Advanced Search. In the example below, the term "fireman" is entered with search type "Full Text." Next click on the plus sign (see red arrow), to get a second field, and in that field enter "death" with
                            search type "Title". Adding "death" should limit the results to records that are death records, excluding birth records where a parent was a fireman. The results of this search should yield a selection of records where the
                            deceased individual may have been a fireman, allowing the searcher to peruse the causes of death for this set of records.</p>

                        <p>Street Addresses if present on records are entered in the <strong>Description</strong> field. Any abbreviations or misspellings on the original record are not changed. Addresses are sometimes recorded as the name of a hospital
                            or group residence, such as "Childrens Home". The description field is included in the general keyword search. To search with precision for a street address, first go to <strong>Advanced Search</strong> from the main community
                            page or within individual collections for a year range, and then select 'Description' as the 'Search Type'. You can combine an address search with a name search as is shown in the example below, which demonstrates searching

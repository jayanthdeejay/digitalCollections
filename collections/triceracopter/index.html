She retired from the University of Cincinnati in 2000 as Professor Emerita in Fine Arts, College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning. She died on May 7, 2007. Triceracopter is engineered in section. The overall length is 30-feet. It is 11-feet high, without the platform. (Coincidentally, a mature triceratops and this helicopter both measure 30-feet.) The overall width of the body is 8-feet long, not counting the rotor blades, each about 10-feet long. Triceracopter and Self-Portrait are donations to the university from Laura H. Chapman. They have found a new home in Walter C. Langsam Library."

                        the Ohio Historical Society and the State Legislature of Ohio. Under this program, the University of Cincinnati is the designated repository for government records for the eight southwestern Ohio counties and their municipalities
                        and other governmental agencies when the records cannot be maintained by those public offices.</p>

                        upon posting of a monetary bond. This particular Bureau represented the 1st District of Ohio, i.e. Hamilton County. Records have been digitized, and prominent names and dates have been entered into the metadata -- Browse Subjects

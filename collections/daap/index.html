                    <p>The DAAP Digital Image Teaching Collection represents core images required to support the DAAP curriculum. These images span a broad spectrum of the visual arts including contemporary performance artists to urban landscapes. Included
                        in the collection are images of urban planning projects from China, Africa, Europe, and the United States. Many of these images represent research projects of the College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning faculty and students.
                        Images of the built environment are from the Cincinnati Preservation Association, professional and amateur photographers, and from students and staff at the University of Cincinnati. The collection is growing continually.</p>
